# ConnectFour

ConnectFour is a plugin inspired by the Mineplex player cosmetics hub game.
The plugin is a game involving two players that consists of the same rules as the real-life game Connect Four.

## How to start

To start a game run the command
- /connectfour <target> (Target is the player you wish to play against)

## More to come

The current game still has a few additions on its way such as
- Checking to ensure that the playable arena is empty before spawning the board in
- Queuing system to wait for a player to accept the game
